# escapeTheTemple
A Simple Escape the Temple game written in C# for Unity 4.3
I intend to finish this first, then add images to each state.
Will also release periodically on unity web player.

The game is a simple Puzzle game which runs on a big enumerator, calling each function as the state changes. Simple!
